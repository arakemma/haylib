## Haylib: Armenian language resources

Hello and welcome! This is Haylib, a language library for everyone who's trying to learn Armenian. If you're looking to repatriate or simply reconnect with your heritage, Haylib will help you find the best books, movies, and learning apps you can use on your journey.

Haylib is focused on Eastern Armenian for now, but Western Armenian resources will also be added in future.
